# MRM-Research-Ghanashyam_Codes

This Repo has Moveit files for the automation of the Robotic Arm, and This is duplicated from the MRM's Original Private Repo, to just keep track of the codes I wrote months back.

**PICK and PLACE** was simulated for the Robotic Arm using Gazebo and Moveit.

The Workspace is not uploaded as the project is not fully completed. So, only as a proof of my work in this project, **Moveit** codes are uploaded.
